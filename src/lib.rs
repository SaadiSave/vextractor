//! `vextractor` is a simple library for extracting the vocabulary of a text
//! file.

//! extern crate vextractor;
//! use vextractor::vex::Vextract;
//!
//! let x = Vextract::new(
//!     "somepath/somefile.txt", // file containing the text to be processed
//!     vec!["EU", "etc.", "i.e.", "e.g."], // Acronyms
//!     vec!["Germany", "France", "Belgium", "Italy"] // Proper Nouns
//! );
//!
//! println!("{}", x.get_pretty_vocab()); // Prints the vocabulary
//! println!("{}", x.get_sorted_pretty_vocab()); // Sorts, then prints
//!
//! x.write_to_file("somepath/somefile.txt"); // Writes vocab to a text file
//! ```
